Internet of Things (IoT) have become an integral part of our society and are pervasive. In addition to helping users with daily activities, IoT are also used for safety, security, and mission critical operations because of the ease of deploying IoT to develop situational awareness. While there are advantages of IoT, there are also some significant disadvantages including exposure to security and privacy vulnerabilities. These security and privacy related behaviors need to be investigated and well understood to prevent exploitation by people with malicious intent. Additionally, there is a need for IoT specific modeling and analysis frameworks to identify  vulnerabilities as IoT devices are integrated for a given mission. In this research effort, we discuss the design and development of a framework, which we have created to support modeling and analysis of the composition of IoT devices. First, we discuss our approach to experimentally understand the behavior of IoT devices. We then elaborate on the creation of a domain-specific, ontology-based, language named CSADL, propose a new version of CSADL, which we call CSADL++, and demonstrate the IoT related analysis with modeling in CSADL++.
